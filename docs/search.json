    "text": "Urban green space—such as parks, gardens, and recreational areas—is widely recognized as a critical component of environmental quality and public well-being. Access to green space has been linked to improved physical and mental health, greater opportunities for recreation, lower levels of urban heat exposure, and enhanced social cohesion within communities. As cities grow and densify, the equitable distribution of parks becomes a central concern in urban planning and environmental justice.\nMany studies in environmental justice have found that socially advantaged neighborhoods often enjoy better access to ecological and recreational amenities, while lower-income communities may face “green space deficits.” These disparities can contribute to unequal health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and structural inequities embedded within the urban landscape.\nThis project investigates the spatial distribution of parks in Washington, D.C. and evaluates whether higher-income neighborhoods receive disproportionately greater access to green space. Specifically, the study focuses on first-order spatial properties through the estimation of an inhomogeneous intensity function and employs simulation-based hypothesis testing to assess whether observed patterns differ significantly from those expected under a population-driven null model.\nBy integrating open-source geospatial data with point-pattern methods from spatial statistics, this research contributes to understanding the extent of environmental inequality in the nation’s capital and highlights broader implications for urban planning and equitable resource allocation."

    "text": "3.1 Data Sources and Preprocessing\nTwo primary datasets were used:\n\nPark locations from OpenStreetMap (OSM), represented both as polygons and as centroid points.\nSocioeconomic attributes from the American Community Survey (ACS) at the census tract level, including median household income and population.\n\nAll spatial data were transformed to EPSG:3857, a planar meter-based projection suitable for distance and surface-density computations. For each census tract, park areas were intersected and aggregated to compute:\n\nTotal park area per tract (sqm)\nPark density: park area per capita\n\\[\n\\text{park density} = \\frac{\\text{park area}}{\\text{population}}\n\\]\n\nThese variables provide the socio-economic and environmental covariates necessary for subsequent analysis."

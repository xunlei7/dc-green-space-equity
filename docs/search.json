    "text": "Urban green space—such as parks, gardens, and recreational areas—is widely recognized as a critical component of environmental quality and public well-being. Access to green space has been linked to improved physical and mental health, greater opportunities for recreation, lower levels of urban heat exposure, and enhanced social cohesion within communities. As cities grow and densify, the equitable distribution of parks becomes a central concern in urban planning and environmental justice.\nMany studies in environmental justice have found that socially advantaged neighborhoods often enjoy better access to ecological and recreational amenities, while lower-income communities may face “green space deficits.” These disparities can contribute to unequal health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and structural inequities embedded within the urban landscape.\nWashington, D.C. provides a compelling case study for examining such spatial inequalities. The city exhibits substantial variation in median household income across its census tracts, with pronounced socio-economic differences between Northwest D.C. and the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. At the same time, the District maintains a large inventory of parks and green spaces, making it an ideal environment for studying whether these amenities are evenly—or unevenly—distributed.\nThis project investigates the spatial distribution of parks in Washington, D.C. and evaluates whether higher-income neighborhoods receive disproportionately greater access to green space. Specifically, the study focuses on first-order spatial properties through the estimation of an inhomogeneous intensity function and employs simulation-based hypothesis testing to assess whether observed patterns differ significantly from those expected under a population-driven null model.\nBy integrating open-source geospatial data with point-pattern methods from spatial statistics, this research contributes to understanding the extent of environmental inequality in the nation’s capital and highlights broader implications for urban planning and equitable resource allocation."

Data Sources and Preprocessing\nTwo primary datasets were used:\n\nPark locations from OpenStreetMap (OSM), represented both as polygons and as centroid points.\nSocioeconomic attributes from the American Community Survey (ACS) at the census tract level, including median household income and population.\n\nAll spatial data were transformed to EPSG:3857, a planar meter-based projection suitable for distance and surface-density computations. For each census tract, park areas were intersected and aggregated to compute:\n\nTotal park area per tract (sqm)\nPark density: park area per capita\n\\[\n\\text{park density} = \\frac{\\text{park area}}{\\text{population}}\n\\]\n\nThese variables provide the socio-economic and environmental covariates necessary for subsequent analysis."

    "text": "4.1 Local Moran’s I (LISA) Analysis — Median Income\nLocal Moran’s I reveals that the vast majority of census tracts in Washington, D.C. do not exhibit statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in median household income. This is consistent with the global Moran’s I result (I = –0.035, p = 0.796), which indicates no significant clustering of high- or low-income areas at the city scale.\nOnly a small number of tracts appear as High–Low outliers, meaning that these tracts have relatively high incomes while being surrounded by lower-income neighbors. These patterns correspond to localized gentrifying areas (e.g., Navy Yard, NoMa, parts of Capitol Hill), but do not represent citywide spatial clustering.\nNo significant High–High (wealth clusters) or Low–Low (poverty clusters) regions were detected once statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) was applied."

    "text": "5.1 Hypothesis Testing Results\n\n5.1.1 1. Park Intensity KDE (Observed)\nThe kernel density estimation (KDE) map shows two clear concentration zones where parks are densely located. These high-intensity areas reflect clusters of parks in central and northwest Washington, D.C. This provides initial visual evidence that park locations are not uniformly distributed across space.\n\n\n5.1.2 2. CSR Envelope Test (999 Simulations)\nBy comparing the observed intensity surface with 999 Monte Carlo simulations under Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR), we identify large regions where observed park density is significantly higher than expected under random distribution. These areas (highlighted in green) confirm strong clustering of park locations, rejecting the CSR null hypothesis.\n\n\n5.1.3 3. Income Surface (Mapped onto KDE Grid)\nEach KDE grid point is matched to its nearest census tract income. This map reveals a strong spatial divide: high-income zones are concentrated west of the Anacostia River, while lower-income regions occupy the eastern side. This step allows us to statistically connect income and park intensity.\n\n\n5.1.4 4. Correlation: Park Intensity vs Income\nA Pearson correlation test shows:\n\nCorrelation coefficient: 0.142\n\np-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\nThis indicates a small but statistically significant positive association between park intensity and neighborhood median income. Higher-income areas tend to have slightly higher park density.\n\n\n5.1.5 5. High-Income vs Low-Income Comparison\nA Welch two-sample t-test comparing KDE intensity between high- and low-income areas finds:\n\nHigh-income mean intensity: 2.08×10⁻⁹\n\nLow-income mean intensity: 1.68×10⁻⁹\n\np-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\nThis demonstrates a significant difference: high-income neighborhoods have measurably greater park density."

    "text": "5.2 Summary of Findings\n\n✔️ Park locations are significantly clustered, not random, based on CSR simulations.\n\n✔️ Income and park density are positively correlated, though the effect size is modest.\n\n✔️ High-income areas have higher average park intensity than low-income areas.\n\n✔️ Both correlation and t-test results are highly significant, reinforcing evidence of inequity.\n\n\n5.2.1 Conclusion\nAcross multiple formal statistical tests, there is strong evidence of spatial inequity in park access. High-income neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. benefit from significantly greater park density compared to low-income areas. This supports the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of green space in the city reflects existing patterns of economic inequality."

    "text": "Urban green space—such as parks, gardens, and recreational areas—is widely recognized as a critical component of environmental quality and public well-being. Access to green space has been linked to improved physical and mental health, greater opportunities for recreation, lower levels of urban heat exposure, and enhanced social cohesion within communities. As cities grow and densify, the equitable distribution of parks becomes a central concern in urban planning and environmental justice.\nMany studies in environmental justice have found that socially advantaged neighborhoods often enjoy better access to ecological and recreational amenities, while lower-income communities may face “green space deficits.” These disparities can contribute to unequal health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and structural inequities embedded within the urban landscape.\nWashington, D.C. provides a compelling case study for examining such spatial inequalities. The city exhibits substantial variation in median household income across its census tracts, with pronounced socio-economic differences between Northwest D.C. and the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. At the same time, the District maintains a large inventory of parks and green spaces, making it an ideal environment for studying whether these amenities are evenly—or unevenly—distributed.\nThis project investigates the spatial distribution of parks in Washington, D.C. and evaluates whether higher-income neighborhoods receive disproportionately greater access to green space. Specifically, the study focuses on first-order spatial properties through the estimation of an inhomogeneous intensity function and employs simulation-based hypothesis testing to assess whether observed patterns differ significantly from those expected under a population-driven null model.\nBy integrating open-source geospatial data with point-pattern methods from spatial statistics, this research contributes to understanding the extent of environmental inequality in the nation’s capital and highlights broader implications for urban planning and equitable resource allocation."

    "text": "3.1 Data Sources and Preprocessing\nTwo primary datasets were used:\n\nPark locations from OpenStreetMap (OSM), represented both as polygons and as centroid points.\nSocioeconomic attributes from the American Community Survey (ACS) at the census tract level, including median household income and population.\n\nAll spatial data were transformed to EPSG:3857, a planar meter-based projection suitable for distance and surface-density computations. For each census tract, park areas were intersected and aggregated to compute:\n\nTotal park area per tract (sqm)\nPark density: park area per capita\n\\[\n\\text{park density} = \\frac{\\text{park area}}{\\text{population}}\n\\]\n\nThese variables provide the socio-economic and environmental covariates necessary for subsequent analysis."

This provides initial evidence that park locations exhibit spatial concentration rather than a uniform distribution.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Linking KDE Grid With Census Attributes\nFindings: This code assigns each spatial grid cell the income value of its nearest census tract. This enables formal statistical testing between park density (continuous spatial surface) and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Correlation Test\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  grid_df$obs_intensity and grid_df$nearest_income\nt = 28.612, df = 39998, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.1320069 0.1512136\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.1416236 \n\n\nFindings: The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.142, with a p-value &lt; 2.2e−16. Although the effect size is small, the relationship is statistically significant, indicating that higher-income neighborhoods tend to correspond to slightly higher park intensity.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 High-Income vs Low-Income T-Test\n\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  high_income_grid$obs_intensity and low_income_grid$obs_intensity\nt = 18.883, df = 36804, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 3.554112e-10 4.377412e-10\nsample estimates:\n   mean of x    mean of y \n2.078248e-09 1.681672e-09 \n\n\nFindings: The Welch t-test shows a highly significant difference between the two groups (p &lt; 2.2e−16). High-income areas have a notably higher mean KDE intensity, demonstrating that park density systematically varies across socioeconomic strata.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Raster Plot: Observed Park Intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings: The intensity surface highlights spatial concentration patterns consistent with previously identified KDE hotspots. This visualization reinforces evidence that parks are unevenly distributed across the city.\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Scatter Plot: Income vs Park Intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings: A positive linear trend is visible, consistent with the correlation result. The fitted line shows that park intensity tends to increase gradually with rising income.\n\n\n\n4.1.8 Numerical Summary**\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS\n\n\nCorrelation: 0.1416236 P-value: 2.96697e-178 \n\n\nHigh-income mean: 2.078248e-09 \n\n\nLow-income mean: 1.681672e-09 \n\n\nT-test P-value: 3.760954e-79 \n\n\nFindings: All reported statistics—correlation, mean differences, and t-test results—demonstrate a consistent pattern: park density is higher in neighborhoods with higher median incomes.\n\n\n4.1.9 Conclusion\nAcross multiple formal statistical tests, there is strong evidence of spatial inequity in park access. High-income neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. benefit from significantly greater park density compared to low-income areas. This supports the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of green space in the city reflects existing patterns of economic inequality."
